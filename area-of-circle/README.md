# Area of a circle

This is a very simple interview question that I have come across before.
Normally it's an introductory question, does what it says on the tin,
calculates the area of a circle given the radius.

Some simple examples of expected results given a list of inputs are shown below:

* discuss options for handling very large radius values, i.e. us big decimal
* what edge cases would you test? 
* what would you suggest to handle those edge cases?
