# First Unique Character

This is an interview question that I have come across before. The
idea is to write some code to find the unique character from an input string.

Some simple examples of expected results given a list of inputs are shown below:

* given input "AABBCDE", the function should return 'C'
* given inputs "AA", there is no unique character, up to you to decide what to do
* should you cater for any other edge cases e.g. null input
* there is a need to give thought to efficiency when building the solution
