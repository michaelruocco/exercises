# Reactive Batch Processor

This was my own attempt at working through the exercise described
[here](https://reflectoring.io/rxjava-reactive-batch-processing/). I have made a
subtle change by using project reactor rather than rxjava. I have also added
a unit test for each of the initial versions to demonstrate the impact of the
issues that need to be resolved along the way.
