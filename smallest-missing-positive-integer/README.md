# Smallest Missing Positive Integer

This was a demo exercise from [codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/). The
idea is to write some code to find the smallest positive integer from an input array
of integers excluding zero and ignoring any negative numbers.

Some simple examples of expected results given a list of inputs are shown below:

* given inputs = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5
* given inputs = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4
* given inputs = [−1, −3], the function should return 1
* there is a need to give thought to efficiency when building the solution
